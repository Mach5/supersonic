To build and install from source there are different steps depending on what
platform you are on and how you want the resulting binary packaged.


Linux
=====

First install the packages needed to build Supersonic. It depends on Java and
the Maven build environment:


Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo apt-get install maven2 openjdk-6-jdk

RedHat/Fedora
su -c "yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel maven2"

OpenSUSE
sudo zypper install java-1_6_0-openjdk-devel-1.6.0 maven2

ArchLinux
sudo pacman -Sy  openjdk6
You will then have to get Maven from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=44684


Change directory into the folder which holds the Supersonic source code and run
Maven to install a binary package for your distribution:

cd <supersonic source folder>
mvn clean -P full; mvn install -P full


Then install the now built binary package for your distribution:

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo dpkg -i subsonic-installer-debian/target/supersonic-<version number>.deb

Fedora/RedHat
su -c "rpm -i subsonic-installer-rpm/supersonic-<version number>.rpm"

OpenSUSE
sudo zypper install subsonic-installer-rpm/supersonic-<version number>.rpm

Archlinux

Starting Supersonic:
Once Supersonic is installed it may be started automatically depending on your
specific distro. An manual start may be triggered like this:

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/OpenSUSE
sudo /etc/init.d/supersonic restart

Fedora/RedHat
su -c "service supersonic restart"

Archlinux
sudo /etc/rc.d/supersonic restart


Windows
=======

Download and install Java JDK from Oracle:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Download and install Apache Maven: http://maven.apache.org/
Installation instructions: http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation_Instructions


Build the sourcecode with Maven. This assumes that you have followed the
installation instructions provided above for Maven:

Open the start menu and enter: 
cmd

When the command prompt appears switch to the folder in which you downloaded
the Supersonic sourcecode:
cd <folder containing Supersonic>

Then build Supersonic with:
mvn install
