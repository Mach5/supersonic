To build and install from source there are different steps depending on what platform your're on and how you want the resulting binary packaged.


Linux
=====

First install the packages needed to build supersonic. It depends on Java 6 and the Maven build environment:


Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo apt-get install maven2 openjdk-6-jdk

RedHat/Fedora
su -c "yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel maven2"

OpenSUSE
sudo zypper install java-1_6_0-openjdk-devel-1.6.0 maven2

ArchLinux
sudo pacman -Sy  openjdk6
You will then have to get maven from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=44684


After this change directory into the folder which holds the subsonic sourcecode and run maven to install a binary package for your distribution:

cd <supersonic source folder>
mvn clean -P full; mvn install -P full


Then install the now built binary package for your distribution:

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo dpkg -i subsonic-installer-debian/target/supersonic-<version number>.deb

Fedora/RedHat
su -c "rpm -i subsonic-installer-rpm/supersonic-<version number>.rpm"

OpenSUSE
sudo zypper install subsonic-installer-rpm/supersonic-<version number>.rpm

Archlinux
We currently do not know what mvn builds results in on Archlinux, please correct this file if you do and submit the changes to supersonic on github.


Starting Supersonic:
Once supersonic is installed it could be automaticly started or not depending on your specific distro, but we will make sure it starts either way:

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/OpenSUSE
sudo /etc/init.d/supersonic restart

Fedora/RedHat
su -c "service supersonic restart"

Archlinux
sudo /etc/rc.d/supersonic restart


Windows
=======

Download and install Java JDK from Oracle: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Download and install Apache Maven: http://maven.apache.org/
Installation instructions: http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation_Instructions


Build the sourcecode with maven, this assumes that you have fallowed the installation instructions provided above for maven:

Open the start menu and enter: 
cmd

When the command prompt appears switch to the folder in which you downloaded the supersonic sourcecode:
cd <folder containing subsonic>

Then build supersonic with:
mvn install


Here needs to fallow instructions on what to do with which compiled file in order to start up the newly compiled application. Please fill this in if you know how to proceed.
